# PHP Dalle-2 / Make it Simple
PHP to Generate Images with Dalle 2

Very basic start of PHP GUI to interface with Dalle-2.

The download button is not working at this point, looking for others to make the project better.

To get started, download project and be sure to change in checkbox-download.php: "$api_key = 'sk-YOUR-KEY-HERE';"

This project should work on most PHP enabled hosts, no other special requirements other than CURL.
